#Motivation & Summary Slide

#Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.
We are looking to use machine learning model to create a stock portfolio that would outperform the S&P500 benchmark. our hypothesis is that by combining fundamental and technical indicators we could have a portfolio of stocks that outperforms consistently the S&P 500 and rebalances on a monthly basis. This strategy can be easily replicated on different countries. 




#Model Summary

#Elaborate on the predictive model used, describing why it was the best choice for the data.
We used gradient boosting algorithm as a classification approach. We have a combination of fundamental and technical features as inputs, we are forcasting outperformers and underperformers on a monthly basis. We are training on 12 months worth of data and using the trained model to predict the next forward monthly return. and rolling the model every month. 




#Data Cleanup & Model Training

#Describe the exploration and cleanup process.
#Discuss any problems that arose with preparing the data or training the model that you didn't anticipate.
#Discuss the overall training process and highlight anything of interest with the training process: Cloud resources used, training time #required, issues with training.



#Model Evaluation

#Discuss the techniques you used to evaluate the model performance.



#Discussion

#Discuss your findings. Was the model sufficient for the predictive task? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can #you draw from your model performance?



#Postmortem

#Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them.
#Discuss any additional questions or problems that came up but you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next if you had #two more weeks?



#Questions

#Open-floor Q&A with the audience.
