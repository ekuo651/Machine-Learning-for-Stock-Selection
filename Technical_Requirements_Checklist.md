# Technical Requirements Checklist


* We used Jupyter Notebook & Google Colab Notebook.

* We used PCA to visualize cluster results from K-means clustering. We also calculated many metrics based off of historic stock price as features to be used in the Gradient Boost Model as well as the TensorFlow LSTM model. 

* We used K-means clustering, SGBoost and LSTM models.

* We were able to successfully fit both the K-means clustering and SGBoost models. 

* PNG's saved in "Presentation Resources Folder"

* We evaluated K-means clustering using silhouette analysis which looks for the degree of differentiation among clusters.

* README.md uploaded
